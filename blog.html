          <p>The difference between something you want and something you love can be illustrated by how you treat a flower. When you want something you’ll take it for yourself. And that flower then exists as an extension of you, it’s beauty measured by how beautiful you’ll allow it to be.</p>
          <p>We often feel the need to have possession over the things we love. But when you love something you discover an appreciation for everything it is, knowing something so beautiful, so vast, could never belong only to you. Seeing its light and knowing it would be so selfish to hold it hostage from the world. </p>
          <p>I pity those who have not gotten the chance to experience you. And at the beginning of this love, I only wanted you for myself. I am now learning to love you from three steps back, wanting only to experience this love with you. I will not interrupt the path you’ve forged for yourself, I’ll stand beside you, championing your growth. I’ll not demand that you change for me. I only ask that you change for the better.</p>
          <p>I want to see you grow as I stand alongside you. As humans we are so complex, there is immense depth to our minds and our souls. How selfish would it be for me to think I could be everything for you? So instead, I’ll be everything I am, letting you be everything you are. And going forward we’ll face everything together.</p>
